            <h1>A small donation can make a huge difference.</h1>
        <p>
            Giving to charity can be one of the easiest ways to make yourself feel good. It is a highly effective way of generating that amazing warm glow feeling --- the same one you feel when you help your neighbour, your friend, a family member, or a co-worker. Charity is not just for the ultra-wealthy. You (yes you, the exact person reading this sentence right now) can make a massive difference in the lives of others while simultaneously benefiting yourself --- one of those coveted win-win scenarios!
